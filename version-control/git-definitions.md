# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

It helps web developers view the entire history of revisions to one or more files and having the ability to merge revisions made by different people.  It is very useful to keep things organize and to go back on the timeline to fix anything.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is what you you would use to make changes to your original or master branch.  
These new branches are good to play around with and see if it will be good enough to be merge into your original project. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is basically like saving a specific part of your code.  A good commit message would be describing your save point for future reference.  

* What is a merge conflict?

Sometimes you get merge conflicts when merging or pulling from a branch.  When that happens, your terminal will tell you to fix the conflicts and then commit the result.
