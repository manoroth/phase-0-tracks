<!--What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
-The purpose of HTML5 semantic tags gives the document a more organize layout.
-The most useful tag that I found would be the <nav> tags. Nav tags are used frequently to link other pages or parts within a page.
What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
-From my research, the browser will order elements from top to bottom in which they appear in the document.
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
-I learned that sublime is a very powerful tool and there are many options to help us easily navigate while we code.   Especially the new snippet feature.  This is something I can see myself using in the near future, which will help save some time from typing a long string of code characters.
What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
I felt that I had a good understanding of each challenge.  I would say that I still would like to read up on the different semantic elements just to get a better context of it. Also, creating a table can be tricky when you add rowspans, so I think I will keep on practicing on that as well.
